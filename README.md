**Project Topic: Cash Register system (_Lavender_)**

# Problem Setting
**_Lavender_** is a grocery store selling a large variety of items for customers. The time customers spending at register is varying with 
the amount of item they are buying. The customers with grocery will wait in a line before the 4 cashiers in the store. If the customers 
waited too long for the register, they will leave without buying anything. Thus, it is unavoidable if the waiting line is too long. With 
the expense of each cashiers runnung at $60 per hour ($1 per minute). A cash register system is in need for maximumizing the profits of 
the store. The system must be dynamic with the amount of customers and be able to change its grocery list from time to time, depending 
on the store managers want to add items for sells or delete items for shortage or other needs.
